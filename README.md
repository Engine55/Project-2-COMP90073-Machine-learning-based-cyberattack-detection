Project 2: Machine learning based cyberattack detection

There were two tasks in this project: Task I aimed to develop our skills in applying unsupervised machine learning techniques for anomaly detection; and Task II helped us to better understand how to use gradient descent-based method to generate adversarial samples against supervised learning models beyond the computer vision domain. Specifically, two network traffic (NetFlow) datasets were provided, one for each task. Both datasets contained botnet traffic and normal traffic. We identified botnet IP addresses from both datasets. In addition, for Task II we also chose a botnet IP address, and explained how to manipulate its network traffic in order to bypass detection.

The README.txt file contains a guide for navigating through our notebook files. The COMP90073-Assignment2 contains an explanation on the specs of this project. Also, we include our report in the Assignment 2 COMP90073_992038_DAAV.pdf file.
