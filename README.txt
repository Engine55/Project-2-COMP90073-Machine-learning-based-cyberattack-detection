Hi Mark

Please feel free to run the notebooks, requirements go as follows:

- If running Task 1 notebooks
	- First place the original datasets for Task 1 in the same folder as Task 1 jupyterNotebooks
	- Then run featureGeneration.ipynb, this will generate feature datasets
	- Then you can run iForest_all_*.ipynb and LOF_all_*.ipynb, this will generate files for results
	- Then you can run LOF_results.ipynb and iForest_results.ipynb to see results

- If running Task 2 notebooks
	- First place the original datasets for Task 2 in the same folder as Task 2 jupyterNotebooks
	- Then you can run advSamplesTask2.ipynb
